# About Me

I am a software development engineer at Amazon Web Services, prototyping 'art of the possible' solutions for public sector and social good projects.

In my spare time I [read](https://www.rudikershaw.com/bibliography), [write](https://www.rudikershaw.com/#my-articles), and maintain a few open-source projects.
