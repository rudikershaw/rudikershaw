			<p class="text-container">Hi I'm Whichpet, a weak AI program that can work out from a description of your pet the kind of animal you are talking about.
				At the moment I can understand when you're talking about cats, dogs, fish, birds, horses and reptiles. Feel free to describe your
				pet below and I'll see if I can guess which type of pet it is. If I get it wrong you can tell me what type of pet it was and I can
				learn from it!</p>

			<div id="they-clicked-for-more" style="display: none;">
				<p>Whichpet is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Naive Bayes Classifier</a> written in Javascript. What that means is that it works out the probabilities that you are describing a pet of each
					type by calculating the probability that you would use certain words. How does it know the probabilities? Well, you provide them.
					Every time someone describes a pet and tells it which type of pet it was, data is added to a large list which it uses to work out the
					chances.</p>
				<br />
				<p>I created Whichpet because I wanted to create an example of a very simple AI or Machine Learning program. It's easy for machine learning to feel
					a little like magic, but once you peer beneath the hood machine intelligence is usually just a combination of fairly simple tricks.</p>
				<br />
				<p>In a later article I am going to talk about how machine learning and AI needn't feel like magic, and can be simple for everyone to understand.</p>
