      "blerb": "A concise introduction to statistics covering all the basics. Statistics Without Tears avoids focusing on mathematical formula and instead uses good descriptions and examples to impress an intuitive understanding of each concept.",
      "review": "I've encountered almost all the concepts in this book through my professional and academic career, but until reading this I didn't have a good intuitive understanding of what they really meant. A good read."

      "review": "Mythos was a wonderful detour from my usual genre of reading. Stephen Fry tells the stories wonderfully while throwing in tid-bits about how the names of various Gods etc relate to modern words. A very enjoyable read."

      "blerb": "A tour of the research into longevity by someone deep in the field of aging. David Sinclair presents an optimistic view of where the research is headed and talks about what that might mean for our future.",
      "review": "I enjoyed the book thoroughly and feel more optimistic now about treating human aging. One thing I will say however is that David Sinclair is not a skeptic. He is very quick to interpret significance to very early research."

      "review": "I have a medical background myself, with a strong focus on human anatomy. So there were very few surprises when it came to what's where and how it works. I did however derive great enjoyment from hearing about how we discovered everything we know, down to the personal histories of the inventors and discovers in question."

      "blerb": "A scientific justification of the claims of westernized secular Buddhism, looked at through the lenses of neurophysiology and evolutionary psychology.",
      "review": "The book gets a little weird in places where there are detours into ancient Buddhist texts, but that's because ancient texts tend to be a little bit weird. Over-all it is a good summary of the base concepts underlying Buddhism, as well as some of the more common meditative practices."

      "review": "I very much enjoy David Mitchell's angry sarcastic humour, but I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as I expected to. I don't really know what I was expecting. It was funny, but I was hoping to learn something. I was probably barking up the wrong tree on that one."

      "review": "It's 60 pages long, and frankly it is an important historical document. You should read it. Most people's definitions of communism is incoherent at best and it is good to know what Marx thought it meant, which-ever side of the political divide you happen to find yourself on. That said, Marx was not a clear or concise writer and so it might be difficult to work out precisely what he thought."

      "review": "The Witcher books are a stark, depressing, and realistic take on the traditional fairy-tale and fantasy adventure tropes. The story kicks up a gear in this book, but there are no satisfying conclusions and you have to pick up the next book immediately to find out what happens."

      "blerb": "Nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman sets out what ought to have been done to put an end to the global economic depression that started in 2010.",
      "review": "Clear and articulate for such a complicated subject. The book focuses on what the US did to try and pull through, but has occasional special mentions for the UK (because of how ridiculous our ultimate strategy was). An important and enlightening read."

      "review": "I am glad I read Basic Economics. I definitely learned a great deal. I do however have a few complaints. Thomas Sowell is very extremely libertarian, and he's quite pushy about it throughout the book. I would also describe his work as extremely reductionist. I'll just leave it at that."

      "review": "A very interesting read, and typical of Dick's work. A few of the characters loose their grip on reality in typical Philip K. Dick style, and I was left so confused by the conclusion that I had to sit there for about 10 minutes just to think about what it meant."

Waking Up is no exception, and presents an intriguing look into the nature of self, free will, volition, and the rest."

      "review": "If you're unfamiliar with the study of human fallibility, I think this book might be life changing. Even with a keen interest in the subject myself I found the particular of his work on prospect theory and the nature of how we think fascinating. It's a long read, but I highly recommend it."
