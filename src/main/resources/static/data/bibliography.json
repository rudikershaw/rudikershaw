      "review": "I've encountered almost all the concepts in this book through my professional and academic career, but until reading this I didn't have a good intuitive understanding of what they really meant. A good read."

      "review": "I have a medical background myself, with a strong focus on human anatomy. So there were very few surprises when it came to what's where and how it works. I did however derive great enjoyment from hearing about how we discovered everything we know, down to the personal histories of the inventors and discovers in question."

      "review": "The book gets a little weird in places where there are detours into ancient Buddhist texts, but that's because ancient texts tend to be a little bit weird. Over-all it is a good summary of the base concepts underlying Buddhism, as well as some of the more common meditative practices."

      "review": "It's 60 pages long, and frankly it is an important historical document. You should read it. Most people's definitions of communism is incoherent at best and it is good to know what Marx thought it meant, which-ever side of the political divide you happen to find yourself on. That said, Marx was not a clear or concise writer and so it might be difficult to work out precisely what he thought."

Thomas Sowell is very extremely libertarian, and he's quite pushy about it throughout the book. I would also describe his work as extremely reductionist. I'll just leave it at that."

It is a little dry, but I've not seen the classic pattern described so simply and elegantly as in the examples set out in the book. If you're unfamiliar with design patterns, this is definitely a good start."

Bostrom has a coherent argument for why he believes AI will destroy or enslave us. But they mostly boil down to empty probabilisms, dodgy generalizations of Moore's law, and a faulty understanding of generality in intelligence. Bostrom completely ignores priors."
